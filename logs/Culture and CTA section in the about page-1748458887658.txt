{"text":"The Culture and CTA sections have been updated to align with Fly.io’s unique culture and mission:\n\n**Culture Section (Our Culture):**\n- The values now reflect Fly.io’s direct, developer-centric, and transparent environment:\n  - Radical transparency (public incident logs, candid communication)\n  - Everyone ships (code from founders and new hires alike)\n  - Bias for action (ship features, fix fast, true ownership)\n  - Direct support (engineers help customers directly)\n  - Low ego, high standards (debate hard, check egos)\n\n**CTA Section:**\n- The call-to-action now encourages technically-minded applicants to join Fly.io to help build serious global infrastructure. It’s direct, plainspoken, and links to both open roles and a contact option:\n  - Title: “Help build the world's developer cloud”\n  - Subtitle: “Join us at Fly.io”\n  - Description: “Fly.io is a team of builders, not buzzword collectors. You'll ship real infrastructure, work directly with smart developers, and solve hard problems every week. Curious? See our open roles or just start a conversation.”\n  - Buttons: “See open roles” and “Say hello”\n\nThese edits ensure the About page expresses Fly.io’s values and appeals to the kind of developers the company hopes to attract. No buzzwords—just facts, action, and a strong team ethos.

Shared service hosts? Still private.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Packed for full-stack teams</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Run your Rails, Phoenix, Django, Node, Go, or Rust app the same way, globally</li>\n  <li>Attach local NVMe volumes or scale-to-zero when idle</li>\n  <li>Get real logs, metrics, and reliable rollbacks built-in</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Instant VMs, infinite flexibility</h2>\n<p>\nFly Machines start in milliseconds and give you full compute isolation—whether you're handling long-lived services, event workers, remote editors, or per-user LLM sandboxes.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Stateful and scalable</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Attach volumes to any machine</li>\n  <li>Use pooled Postgres with global replicas</li>\n  <li>Run SQLite in multi-region clusters with LiteFS Cloud</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>AI inference where it counts</h2>\n<p>\nDeploy AI/ML models on low-latency GPUs across multiple metro regions. Run Model Context Protocol (MCP) or HTTP workloads and serve responses faster.\n</p>\n\n<h2>CLI-first. API on demand.</h2>\n<p>\nUse <code>flyctl</code> to provision machines, manage volumes, scale apps—and wire it into CI/CD via CLI or REST API.

Fly.io uses fast-booting micro-VMs to run containerized apps with minimal cold start time, has a global Anycast backbone to route requests instantly, and offers local NVMe-backed volumes to keep data close and performance tight. From the beginning, we focused on giving developers a simple yet powerful CLI-first experience through flyctl, because we use terminals too, and clicking through hidden settings is nobody’s idea of fun.\",\n39: \t\t\"Today, teams building everything from Rails monoliths to Elixir LiveView apps, Laravel backends, AI inference services, and multi-region databases are using Fly.io to ship more, scale globally, and worry less. We’re trusted by startups and companies like Supabase, Tailscale, and Mailgun.

As engineers who’ve spent years building software and working on internet infrastructure, we knew developers deserved better tools to run apps globally—without needing an ops team or playing cloud maze-chase.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built a platform that makes it easy to run full-stack apps and their databases right where your users are—anywhere in the world. Fly.io uses fast-booting micro-VMs to run containerized apps with minimal cold start time, has a global Anycast backbone to route requests instantly, and offers local NVMe-backed volumes to keep data close and performance tight. From the beginning, we focused on giving developers a simple yet powerful CLI-first experience through flyctl, because we use terminals too, and clicking through hidden settings is nobody’s idea of fun.\",\n39: \t\t\"Today, teams building everything from Rails monoliths to Elixir LiveView apps, Laravel backends, AI inference services, and multi-region databases are using Fly.io to ship more, scale globally, and worry less. We’re trusted by startups and companies like Supabase, Tailscale, and Mailgun.

Fly.io uses fast-booting micro-VMs to run containerized apps with minimal cold start time, has a global Anycast backbone to route requests instantly, and offers local NVMe-backed volumes to keep data close and performance tight. From the beginning, we focused on giving developers a simple yet powerful CLI-first experience through flyctl, because we use terminals too, and clicking through hidden settings is nobody’s idea of fun.\",\n39: \t\t\"Today, teams building everything from Rails monoliths to Elixir LiveView apps, Laravel backends, AI inference services, and multi-region databases are using Fly.io to ship more, scale globally, and worry less.

Fly.io uses fast-booting micro-VMs to run containerized apps with minimal cold start time, has a global Anycast backbone to route requests instantly, and offers local NVMe-backed volumes to keep data close and performance tight. From the beginning, we focused on giving developers a simple yet powerful CLI-first experience through flyctl, because we use terminals too, and clicking through hidden settings is nobody’s idea of fun.\",\n39: \t\t\"Today, teams building everything from Rails monoliths to Elixir LiveView apps, Laravel backends, AI inference services, and multi-region databases are using Fly.io to ship more, scale globally, and worry less. We’re trusted by startups and companies like Supabase, Tailscale, and Mailgun.
