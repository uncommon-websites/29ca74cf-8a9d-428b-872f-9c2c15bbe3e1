Fly.io uses fast-booting micro-VMs to run containerized apps with minimal cold start time, has a global Anycast backbone to route requests instantly, and offers local NVMe-backed volumes to keep data close and performance tight. From the beginning, we focused on giving developers a simple yet powerful CLI-first experience through flyctl, because we use terminals too, and clicking through hidden settings is nobody’s idea of fun.\",\n39: \t\t\"Today, teams building everything from Rails monoliths to Elixir LiveView apps, Laravel backends, AI inference services, and multi-region databases are using Fly.io to ship more, scale globally, and worry less. We’re trusted by startups and companies like Supabase, Tailscale, and Mailgun.

Fly.io uses fast-booting micro-VMs to run containerized apps with minimal cold start time, has a global Anycast backbone to route requests instantly, and offers local NVMe-backed volumes to keep data close and performance tight. From the beginning, we focused on giving developers a simple yet powerful CLI-first experience through flyctl, because we use terminals too, and clicking through hidden settings is nobody’s idea of fun.\",\n39: \t\t\"Today, teams building everything from Rails monoliths to Elixir LiveView apps, Laravel backends, AI inference services, and multi-region databases are using Fly.io to ship more, scale globally, and worry less. We’re trusted by startups and companies like Supabase, Tailscale, and Mailgun. If your users are everywhere, your app should be too—and Fly.io makes that possible in minutes, straight from your terminal.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: "}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"tool-call","toolCallId":"call_qR9GvQLmcSh7Qdx4MCDDjJw1","toolName":"generate_images","args":{"images":[{"aspectRatio":"1:1","prompt":"headshot of a male founder in neutral studio lighting"},{"aspectRatio":"1:1","prompt":"headshot of a male founder with glasses in neutral studio lighting"},{"aspectRatio":"1:1","prompt":"headshot of a male founder with a beard in neutral studio lighting"}]}},{"type":"tool-call","toolCallId":"call_Ged74oPWraAGt3G8WXw3IU8Q","toolName":"write_copy","args":{"topic":"Purpose: Team and investors section for Fly.io's About page.\n\nTone: Direct, concise, honest, and slightly technical—developer-friendly rather than corporate.\n\nTarget Audience: Developers, engineering leaders, and tech company buyers who appreciate authenticity, technical depth, and real information over generic startup platitudes.\n\nContent Details:\n- Only show real founders: Kurt Mackey (CEO), Thomas Ptacek, Jerome Gravel-Niquet.
