Ideal for APIs, tasks, and services that need to start fast and stay lean.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Run apps close to your users</strong><br>Your app runs across over 35 regions—traffic is routed to the nearest healthy instance over Fly’s Anycast network.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Stateful workloads that scale</strong><br>Attach persistent NVMe storage to your VMs or use Fly’s managed Postgres, SQLite (via LiteFS Cloud), and Redis—all replicated across locations.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Simple networking, powerful routing</strong><br>Every app gets global addressing, private networking (via WireGuard), and request routing you can control from the app itself using headers like <code>fly-replay</code>.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Inference-ready infrastructure</strong><br>Run GPU workloads in North America and Europe with low latency—perfect for LLM inference, transcription, real-time vision, or streaming use cases.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Usage-based billing without surprises</strong><br>Pay for what you use. Stop idle instances automatically. Reserve Machines to save long-term. Forgiveness for accidental deployments is built in with paid support.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>No opaque platform logic. Just fast VMs and global networking you control.</h2>\n\n<p>Deploy using <code>fly launch</code>, the REST API, or from CI/CD. Works with any language, framework, or OS.

Deploy in minutes from your command line. Scale up—or to zero—based on traffic. No YAML.</p>\n\n<h2>Six things that make Fly.io different:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Fast-launching VMs anywhere</strong><br>Fly Machines boot in milliseconds and run Docker containers globally. Ideal for APIs, tasks, and services that need to start fast and stay lean.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Run apps close to your users</strong><br>Your app runs across over 35 regions—traffic is routed to the nearest healthy instance over Fly’s Anycast network.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Stateful workloads that scale</strong><br>Attach persistent NVMe storage to your VMs or use Fly’s managed Postgres, SQLite (via LiteFS Cloud), and Redis—all replicated across locations.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Simple networking, powerful routing</strong><br>Every app gets global addressing, private networking (via WireGuard), and request routing you can control from the app itself using headers like <code>fly-replay</code>.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Inference-ready infrastructure</strong><br>Run GPU workloads in North America and Europe with low latency—perfect for LLM inference, transcription, real-time vision, or streaming use cases.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Usage-based billing without surprises</strong><br>Pay for what you use. Stop idle instances automatically. Reserve Machines to save long-term. Forgiveness for accidental deployments is built in with paid support.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>No opaque platform logic. Just fast VMs and global networking you control.</h2>\n\n<p>Deploy using <code>fly launch</code>, the REST API, or from CI/CD. Works with any language, framework, or OS. Ideal for platform teams, solo builders, and anyone building per-user sandboxes, live apps, or global services.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s included</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Global Anycast IPs</li>\n  <li>Private 6PN network powered by WireGuard</li>\n  <li>Built-in Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards</li>  \n  <li>Managed Postgres, distributed SQLite, and Upstash Redis</li>\n  <li>Scale-to-zero, static egress IPs, auto-stop and start</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Get started from your terminal</h2>\n<p>Install the CLI and launch an app in minutes:</p>\n<pre><code>fly launch</code></pre>\n\n<p>No region picking. No YAML.

6 short, clear features for Fly.io's homepage, each highlighting a major USP or differentiator. Tone: Concise, matter-of-fact, technical but not filled with jargon. Target audience: Developers, engineering managers, technical decision makers looking for performant global infrastructure. Content details: Use 1-2 sentences per feature max. Focus on the following strengths: Global low-latency deployments (runs close to users), ultra-fast micro-VMs (Fly Machines) that boot in milliseconds, built-in local persistent storage (Fly Volumes), managed databases (Postgres, LiteFS Cloud, Redis by Upstash), powerful networking (Anycast, WireGuard mesh, 6PN, dynamic routing), and pay-as-you-go with accident forgiveness and scale-to-zero.

Ideal for APIs, tasks, and services that need to start fast and stay lean.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Run apps close to your users</strong><br>Your app runs across over 35 regions—traffic is routed to the nearest healthy instance over Fly’s Anycast network.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Stateful workloads that scale</strong><br>Attach persistent NVMe storage to your VMs or use Fly’s managed Postgres, SQLite (via LiteFS Cloud), and Redis—all replicated across locations.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Simple networking, powerful routing</strong><br>Every app gets global addressing, private networking (via WireGuard), and request routing you can control from the app itself using headers like <code>fly-replay</code>.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Inference-ready infrastructure</strong><br>Run GPU workloads in North America and Europe with low latency—perfect for LLM inference, transcription, real-time vision, or streaming use cases.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Usage-based billing without surprises</strong><br>Pay for what you use. Stop idle instances automatically. Reserve Machines to save long-term. Forgiveness for accidental deployments is built in with paid support.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>No opaque platform logic. Just fast VMs and global networking you control.</h2>\n\n<p>Deploy using <code>fly launch</code>, the REST API, or from CI/CD. Works with any language, framework, or OS. Ideal for platform teams, solo builders, and anyone building per-user sandboxes, live apps, or global services.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s included</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Global Anycast IPs</li>\n  <li>Private 6PN network powered by WireGuard</li>\n  <li>Built-in Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards</li>  \n  <li>Managed Postgres, distributed SQLite, and Upstash Redis</li>\n  <li>Scale-to-zero, static egress IPs, auto-stop and start</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Get started from your terminal</h2>\n<p>Install the CLI and launch an app in minutes:</p>\n<pre><code>fly launch</code></pre>\n\n<p>No region picking.

Content details: Use 1-2 sentences per feature max. Focus on the following strengths: Global low-latency deployments (runs close to users), ultra-fast micro-VMs (Fly Machines) that boot in milliseconds, built-in local persistent storage (Fly Volumes), managed databases (Postgres, LiteFS Cloud, Redis by Upstash), powerful networking (Anycast, WireGuard mesh, 6PN, dynamic routing), and pay-as-you-go with accident forgiveness and scale-to-zero.

Ideal for APIs, tasks, and services that need to start fast and stay lean.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Run apps close to your users</strong><br>Your app runs across over 35 regions—traffic is routed to the nearest healthy instance over Fly’s Anycast network.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Stateful workloads that scale</strong><br>Attach persistent NVMe storage to your VMs or use Fly’s managed Postgres, SQLite (via LiteFS Cloud), and Redis—all replicated across locations.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Simple networking, powerful routing</strong><br>Every app gets global addressing, private networking (via WireGuard), and request routing you can control from the app itself using headers like <code>fly-replay</code>.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Inference-ready infrastructure</strong><br>Run GPU workloads in North America and Europe with low latency—perfect for LLM inference, transcription, real-time vision, or streaming use cases.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Usage-based billing without surprises</strong><br>Pay for what you use. Stop idle instances automatically. Reserve Machines to save long-term. Forgiveness for accidental deployments is built in with paid support.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>No opaque platform logic. Just fast VMs and global networking you control.</h2>\n\n<p>Deploy using <code>fly launch</code>, the REST API, or from CI/CD. Works with any language, framework, or OS. Ideal for platform teams, solo builders, and anyone building per-user sandboxes, live apps, or global services.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s included</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Global Anycast IPs</li>\n  <li>Private 6PN network powered by WireGuard</li>\n  <li>Built-in Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards</li>  \n  <li>Managed Postgres, distributed SQLite, and Upstash Redis</li>\n  <li>Scale-to-zero, static egress IPs, auto-stop and start</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Get started from your terminal</h2>\n<p>Install the CLI and launch an app in minutes:</p>\n<pre><code>fly launch</code></pre>\n\n<p>No region picking.

Content details: Use 1-2 sentences per feature max. Focus on the following strengths: Global low-latency deployments (runs close to users), ultra-fast micro-VMs (Fly Machines) that boot in milliseconds, built-in local persistent storage (Fly Volumes), managed databases (Postgres, LiteFS Cloud, Redis by Upstash), powerful networking (Anycast, WireGuard mesh, 6PN, dynamic routing), and pay-as-you-go with accident forgiveness and scale-to-zero.
