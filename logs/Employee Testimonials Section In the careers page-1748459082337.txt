Deploy across 35+ regions, all from your terminal.</p>\n\n<h2>Fast, flexible compute</h2>\n<p>Spin up Fly Machines—fast-booting, container-compatible VMs optimized for responsiveness and built for scale. Start one in milliseconds. Run thousands if you need to.</p>\n<p>Pay only for what you actually use: per-second, pauseable compute with auto-stop and scale-to-zero capabilities built in.</p>\n\n<h2>Stateful, without the pain</h2>\n<p>Attach persistent NVMe storage to your machines with Fly Volumes. Local, low-latency, and built for the edge.</p>\n<p>Need a managed database? Use Fly Managed Postgres for globally replicated data, or LiteFS Cloud for distributed SQLite workloads.</p>\n\n<h2>The network handles itself</h2>\n<p>Your app gets Anycast IPs by default, routed automatically to the closest machine globally via our `fly-proxy` router and WireGuard mesh.</p>\n<p>Dynamically route requests with a simple header. Keep latency low, even with data locality constraints.</p>\n\n<h2>Works with how you build</h2>\n<p>Whether it's a Rails monolith, LiveView app, Django API, or Node backend, Fly.io supports the platforms and runtimes you work with every day. Full-stack deploys are the default.</p>\n<p>Our CLI, `flyctl`, keeps the feedback loop tight and fast, from deploy to logs to scaling to provisioning VMs dynamically through APIs.</p>\n\n<h2>Now with GPU power</h2>\n<p>Run AI workloads where your users are. Access NVIDIA A100, A40, and L40S GPUs on demand. Perfect for fast model inference, transcriptions, image generation, or per-user sandboxes using large language models.</p>\n<p>Deploy MCP servers, Ollama, or custom PyTorch models without worrying about where or how the hardware gets allocated.</p>\n\n<h2>Build globally with confidence</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>35+ global regions (and counting)</li>\n  <li>6PN private networks over WireGuard</li>\n  <li>Static egress IPs, compliance and SOC2 Type 2</li>\n  <li>Built-in Prometheus/Grafana monitoring</li>\n  <li>Per-region volume snapshots and disaster recovery</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Companies shipping fast with Fly.io</h2>\n<p>Used and loved by teams at Supabase, Tailscale, Glide, Mailgun, Fanatics, SavvyCal, and many more. Because global uptime shouldn't be difficult—or expensive.</p>\n\n<h2>Ready when you are</h2>\n<p>Deploy your first app in under 5 minutes with `flyctl launch`. Start small, scale when you’re ready, and stay close to your users at every step.</p>\n\n<h3><button>Get started for free</button></h3>\n<p><small>No credit card required.

Full-stack deploys are the default.</p>\n<p>Our CLI, `flyctl`, keeps the feedback loop tight and fast, from deploy to logs to scaling to provisioning VMs dynamically through APIs.</p>\n\n<h2>Now with GPU power</h2>\n<p>Run AI workloads where your users are. Access NVIDIA A100, A40, and L40S GPUs on demand. Perfect for fast model inference, transcriptions, image generation, or per-user sandboxes using large language models.</p>\n<p>Deploy MCP servers, Ollama, or custom PyTorch models without worrying about where or how the hardware gets allocated.</p>\n\n<h2>Build globally with confidence</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>35+ global regions (and counting)</li>\n  <li>6PN private networks over WireGuard</li>\n  <li>Static egress IPs, compliance and SOC2 Type 2</li>\n  <li>Built-in Prometheus/Grafana monitoring</li>\n  <li>Per-region volume snapshots and disaster recovery</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Companies shipping fast with Fly.io</h2>\n<p>Used and loved by teams at Supabase, Tailscale, Glide, Mailgun, Fanatics, SavvyCal, and many more.
